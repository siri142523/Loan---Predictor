# 🏦 Risk Assessment & Loan Approval Prediction

A Flask-based web app that predicts **Risk Score (regression)** and **Loan Approval (classification)** based on financial and personal data.

## 📌 Overview

This project uses machine learning models trained on a synthetic dataset to:

- Predict a **Risk Score** for applicants (LGBM Regressor)
- Predict whether a **Loan will be approved** (Random Forest Classifier)

The app provides a user-friendly web interface built using Flask for real-time predictions.

## 🔧 Data & Modeling

All preprocessing, feature engineering, and model testing are documented in **`EDA.ipynb`**. The final selected models are saved and used in **`final_model.ipynb`** and the deployed Flask app.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The app uses Flask to serve a web interface:

- `index.html` for frontend input
- `app.py` for handling predictions
- Models loaded from the `models/` directory
- CSS styling in `static/style.css`

---

## 🧠 Results Summary

- **Risk Score Prediction**: LGBMRegressor (scaled features) gave the best performance.
- **Loan Approval Prediction**: RandomForestClassifier showed highest accuracy and consistency.
